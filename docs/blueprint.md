## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) for a sense of trustworthiness and financial expertise.
- Background color: Very light grayish-teal (#E0EEEE). It is the same hue as the primary color, but heavily desaturated for a clean, professional look.
- Accent color: Mustard yellow (#E1AD01) for highlighting important data points and interactive elements; it is analogous to the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings and titles, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. Playfair provides an elegant, high-end feel, while PT Sans ensures readability for longer text blocks.
- Use minimalist icons for chart types, categories, and filter options.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for data upload, chart display, and interactive controls.
- Subtle transitions and animations when filtering data or generating new charts.
